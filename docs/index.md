<h1>Getting started with React in Meteor</h1>

Using Meteor and React together is awesome. Meteor gives you a fast, easy to use solution
for data management across client and server, and React gives you a way to structure your app's UI from reusable components.

As of Meteor 1.3, React support doesn't have its own guide anymore and is fully integrated into the Meteor Guide and official tutorials. Check them out:

- [The React tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app)
- [The React article in the Meteor Guide](http://guide.meteor.com/react.html)
