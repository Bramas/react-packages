<h1>JSX transpilation and ES6 features</h1>

As of Meteor 1.3, JSX and ES2015+ transpilation is built into the core `ecmascript` package which is installed in all apps by default, so you can use all of the JavaScript features you love out of the box with no configuration.

[Read more about using `ecmascript` in the Meteor Guide.](http://guide.meteor.com/code-style.html#ecmascript)
